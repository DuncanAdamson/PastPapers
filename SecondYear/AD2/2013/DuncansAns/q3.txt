maximum = 1022 (the height of the tree starts at -1 for an empty tree, 0 for the root node 1 for the first children node etc.)
minimum = 9 (log(n + 1) - 1)
To get the maximum height, the data set could be inserted in order (i.e. ascending or descending).
the height of the tree is the distance between the root and the furthest node from it.
e) An AVL tree is a balanced tree which keeps the subtrees from having a height difference of no more than one.
It does this by rotating the tree whenever the height difference exceeds one.
f) The first tree is not AVL as the left subtree has height 3 while the height of the right subtree is 1, therefore it's not balanced.
The second tree is as the difference in height between the two subtrees is only 1
