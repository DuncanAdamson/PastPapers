a) A design pattern is a general template for solving recurring design problems, with the cappacity to be applied to a specific context.
b) The singleton patteren aims to represent an entity as a single instance of a class, this requires the constructor and entity to be accessable, whithout the client being able to creat mpore than one entity.
c)
public class Singleton {
	public static Singleton singelton;
	private Signleton(){
		//initiates the instance
	}
	public static Singleton getSingleton(){
		if (Singleton == null){
			sigketon = new singleton()
		}
		return singleton
	}
}
d) An example for the singleton may be a piece of software for a univeresity, where only the university using it needs to be represnted.
e) Factory pattern
f)
public BuildThreeObjects t;
@before
public void setup(){
	t = new BuildThreeObjects();
}
@after
public void teardown(){
	t = null;
}
@test
public void NoMoreThanThree(){
	int count = 0;
	for(int i = 0;i < 4;i ++){
		if(t.buildObject() != null){
			count ++;
		}
	}
	assertTrue(count == 3);
}
g) This may be useful as it would allow the same instance to be reused after garbage collection without having to initialize a new one. It could be done by having the client decrement the object count during collection if any of the objects are collected as garbage.
