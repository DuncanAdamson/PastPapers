a) A hash table is a map data structure where the key is converted by a hash function to a value, which is used with a list to store or access the data from the table.
b) A hash function is a function that takes the key value and returns a numeric value between 0 and n-1 where n is the size of the table. Ideally we want it not to return the same value for two distinct keys.
c) A collision is when two different keys return the same value from the hash function.
d) Seperate chaining is where each of entries in the hash table is a short list, so that whenever there is a collision on a value, the new one is simply added to the end of the list.
e) In linear probing, when there is a collision the next value along is checked to see if it's empty. If it is, the value is inserted at that point, if not the next value is checked and so on until it reaches the initial value. When looking up, the funtion goes to the value given by the hash function, then if there is a value, it is checked to see if it's the one being looked up, if it is, it returns the value, otherwize it looks up the next one and repeats. When a value is removed, it replaces whatever was at that location with the special removed marker.
