a set of tests first, then writes the code for that section afterwards. 
Behaviour driven is an extension of test driven develpoment where the tests are
written in dommain speciffic language to convert structured natuaral langaue 
into tests. Test driven devlopment is best for when trying to test very

seen by users. BDD is better for testing that user stories are met and 
foccousing on the end functionality of the software.
